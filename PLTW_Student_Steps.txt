Welcome to the PLTW Unit 7: Arraylists Crazy Eights Activity
ArrayLists

How to initialize an array list?
Example:  ArrayList<String> newList = new ArrayList<String>();
The first ArrayList initializes the ArrayList type.
The element type belongs in between the <>.
The name of the arraylist comes right before the = sign.

How to add an item to the ArrayList.
Example: name.add(item);
Name is the name of your ArrayList.
Item is what you're adding to the ArrayList.

How to get an item from your ArrayList.
Example: name.get(item);

How to set an item from your ArrayList.
Example: name.set(index, value);
Index refers to which item from the array list you want to change.
Value is what you want to change it to.

How to check the size of your ArrayList. (useful for this activity.)
Example name.size();

___Activity Walkthrough___
1)
Creating the ArrayLists.
Example: ArrayList<Cards> deck = new ArrayList<Cards>();

2)
Create the Cards to the deck. Reference the Cards.java file if you need help.
Create a new Card and add it to the deck for the number cards
For the face cards
And for the Aces
Example: Cards card = new Cards(y, 1, cardCat); 
         deck.add(card);
         
3)
Deal the Cards out to the Player and Computer
You can do this by randomizing a variable to get a random card.
Then use that variable to create a new card with the same Card Name, Value and Card Type as the randomized card.
After that remove the card from the deck, add it to the hand.
Do this for both the user and the Player
Hint: You will most likely need a loop.
Reference the answer key for help.

4)
Choose the Top Card.
You need to first create a random variable again.
Then simply create a new card: topcard with identical stats to the randomized card. 
After that remove the card from the deck.
See the answer key for help.

5)
Write a for loop letting the user see the hand.
Hind: Use the .size() method.

6)
Write the code that checks for if the user has any legal moves.
Use a nest if statement inside a for loop.
Also make a variable tracking how many cards can be played.

7)
Construct and if statement that checks if the user can play the card they choose.
First go up a few lines and code another part that prints out the user’s hand
For the if statement you need to check if the card played matches the Card Type, Value or if its an 8.
Then change the top card and discard the card from the players hand

8)
Do step 6 but for the computer’s side. (Check for legal moves)

9)
You then need to draw cards for the computer.
You can do this by again find a random card by using a Math.random()
Then remove it from the deck and add it to the computer’s hand.

10)
Reshuffle the deck when it reaches 0 cards.
First check if the deck size is 0.
Then create a for loop that adds the cards to the deck and removes them from the discard pile.
You may need to make sure the topcard stays the same
Then shuffle the deck

11)
Create an enhanced if statement that checks the computer for its playable cards and then plays the first one.
Reference the Answer key for help.

12)
Complete the code for when the user draws cards and when the deck hits 0.
If you completed step 10 use that as reference.

Congratulations, you finished.
